EUI64,"IEEE 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier is comprised of a 24-bit company identifier and a 40-bit instance identifier. The value shall be formatted as 16 ASCII HEX digits, for example, “AABBCC1122334455”. The 24-bit company identifier, formally known as Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI-24), is guaranteed to be globally unique. The 40-bit extensions are assigned by manufacturers. This identifier is often used in equipment interfaces (e.g., “MAC” address format for IPv4 & IPv6).
