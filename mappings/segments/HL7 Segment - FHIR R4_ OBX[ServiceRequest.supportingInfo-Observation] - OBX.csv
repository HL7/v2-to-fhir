That is not known at the standard level, so we cannot provide specific mapping guidance here.  However, if the mapper does not have access to the syntax used and its meaning, we need to be able to pass on OBX-4 Sub Identifier to the final destination that should know how to then structure it using FHIR attributes."
5,OBX-5,Observation Value,varies,0,-1,IF OBX-5 LST.count GREATER THAN 1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Note that when OBX-5 repeats, the standard mapping is to use Observation.component (see OBX[Observation-Component] map) rather than creating separate Observation instances.  However, we are aware that some profiles and implementation guides do separate the OBX into multiple observations depending on the OBX-2 value.  This is an example of a non-standard interpretation as the OBX should have been separated into multiple OBX segments to start.  Please consider the local profiles and implementation guides on how to manage these variants."
