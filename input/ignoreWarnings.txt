# These concept maps are mappings between V2 structures and FHIR, therefore there is no source or target "code system" and system url to specify.
%ConceptMap.group[0]: No Source Code System, so the source codes cannot be checked
%ConceptMap.group[0]: No Target Code System, so the target codes cannot be checked
