# The provenance-activity-type-v2-to-fhir code system is a temporary code system defined in this IG.  The 'v2-fhir-transformation' code is expected to be added to an existing THO code system and included in the provenance-activity-type value set in a future release.  The warning regarding the lack of a version reference in the code system canonical URL is expected and is not an issue.
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/provenance-activity-type-v2-to-fhir: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
