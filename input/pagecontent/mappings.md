The proposed v2-to-FHIR mappings are maintained in spreadsheets (the ultimate format of the maps will be concept maps).
As the v2 Message is the primary endpoint, below all mapped messages are linked below, organized by v2 Chapter.

You can review specific v2-to-FHIR mappings via the links below for:

* [Messages](message_maps.html)
* [Segments](segment_maps.html)
* [Data Types](datatype_maps.html)
* [Tables](coding_system_maps.html)

__NOTE: Due to the build not being up-to-date with the latest spreadsheet we advise the reader to use this link to the [Mapping Spreadsheet Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaFYPSSq4oplTvw_4OgOn6h2Bs_CMvCAU9CqC4tPBgk/edit#gid=1930219638) to review the lastest draft mappings.__
