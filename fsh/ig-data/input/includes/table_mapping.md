When mapping from HL7 v2 messages to FHIR Resources, there are a number of cases where concept mapping needs to be performed.  When this mapping is performed, there may be information that is lost because it cannot be represented in a required coding system, or more specific detail may be lost when one or more codes is mapped to a singular required or preferred code in the FHIR specified terminology.
